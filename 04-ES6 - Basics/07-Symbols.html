    <p id="test">Test Object</p>

    // Types: 
    // primitive: number, string, boolean, null, undefined and symbol (new type in ES6)
    // symbol is a new type. (not string or object)
    let p = document.getElementById("test"); // p is a DOM object.

    // Assume that this object can be used by many libraries, and each library can modify this object
    // it can add new properties or updates.

    // I want to store language in p object.
    // However, lang is already defined in p object. Collision with built-in property (dangerous) 
    p.lang = "Turkish" ;  
    // no collision with built-in properties, but it may collide with other libraries. It is obvious property name.
    p.language = "Turkish" ;

    // Question: you want to store language on this "p" object, what will be your property name?
    p.__myAppName_LanguageName__ = "Turkish" ; // no collision (probably) but ugly.

    // Solution is Symbol.
    let langSymbol = Symbol('translatorApp') ; // "translatorApp" is just a description, no functionality, all symbols are unique 
    // property type is Symbol, and langSymbol is unique, no collision with any libraries. I can store anything without
    // any problem within langSymbol. Other libraries are not aware of langSymbol. They cannot access this property.
    p[langSymbol] = "Turkish" ; 
    
    
    console.log(Object.keys(p)); // Symbol are not enumerable, can not be shown in for-in or Object.keys
    console.log(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(p)) ; // You can see Symbols on an object.
    console.log( langSymbol in p) ; // true

    // REASONS :
    // 1. Symbol is not about hiding or making something private,
    // The aim is to prevent name collision on a shared object.
    
    
    // 2. To add and/or test an interface for an object.
    let arr = [1,2,3] ;
    let name = "ali" ; /* String is an iterable object */
    
    // Symbol.iterator is global symbol (built-in symbols)
    console.log(typeof p[Symbol.iterator] === "function"); // false
    console.log(typeof arr[Symbol.iterator] === "function");  // true
    console.log(typeof name[Symbol.iterator] === "function");  // true
